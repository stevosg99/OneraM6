%
% Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition of the finest grid									%Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) is the size of the "guess" or "change" in simulation from one iteration to the next. A small CFL number (ex. 1) means the 
CFL_NUMBER= 1																			%next attempted solution will be slightly different than the previous. A large CFL number (ex. 100) means the next attempted solution will be very different 
%																						%than the previous. While this number does no directly change how the solver method, it will change the rate at which a solutions is reached. A low CFL will
%																						%incur smaller, safer attempts to answer the problem each iteration. This means the simulation will move more slowly, but it will be less likely to diverge.
%																						%Common Starting Values are as follows
%																						%Internal Flows - <1
%																						%High turblence/high AoA External flows - 1-20
%																						%Low turbulence/low AoA External flows - 20-40

% Adaptive CFL number (NO, YES)															%This allows the CFL number to change each iteration of the simulation. Genreally this is helpful to speed up the simulation, however, if convergence is an

% Local CFL increases by factor-up until max if the solution rate of change is not limited,
% and acceptable linear convergence is achieved. It is reduced if rate is limited, or if there
% is not enough linear convergence, or if the nonlinear residuals are stagnant and oscillatory.
% It is reset back to min when linear solvers diverge, or if nonlinear residuals increase too much.
